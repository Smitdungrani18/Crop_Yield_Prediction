# Crop_Yield_Prediction
### Ensemble Modeling

The goal of this Project is to use machine learning techniques to forecast
yield in different countries of world on a yearly basis. The agricultural sector
is an important pillar of the world economy. Researchers are developing
various scientific technologies in the agriculture field for better yield. In this
project, we try to form an ensemble model using various machine learning
algorithms for better crop production. Crop production prediction utilizing AI
Strategies aims to deliver improved outcomes, but the ensemble model
provides better predictive results compared to the individual algorithm. We
tried to use a combination of symmetric machine learning algorithms to
form an ensemble model for better prediction. Here symmetric algorithms
such as random forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and
Decision tree are individually used for the prediction of the yield of various
crop. While combining all the aforesaid algorithms to form an ensemble
model of a better result. Crop recommendation depends upon weather
conditions, rainfall, use of pesticides, and environment temperature.
Modern technologies need to be integrated into farming practices to
enhance crop productivity. The Machine Learning technique is an essential
approach for building an appropriate model for crop recommendation.
